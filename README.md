![Library Status](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/c6997986557ec6dda98acbdf502082cdf7335526/images/badges/beman_badge-beman_library_under_development.svg)

![Code Format](https://github.com/bemanproject/inplace_vector/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yml/badge.svg)

**Implements**: [`inplace_vector` (P0843R14)](https://wg21.link/P0843R14)

**Status**:
[Under development and not yet ready for production use.](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/BEMAN_LIBRARY_MATURITY_MODEL.md#under-development-and-not-yet-ready-for-production-use)

## Usage

### Definition in P0843

> `inplace_vector` is a dynamically-resizable array with capacity fixed
at compile time and contiguous inplace storage,
that is, the array elements are stored within the vector object itself.
Its API closely resembles `std::vector<T, A>`,
making it easy to teach and learn,
and the inplace storage guarantee makes it useful in environments in
which dynamic memory allocations are undesired.

#### Note on implementation progress

Current implementation implements all public interfaces defined in the paper.

There have been minor updates to the wording after the paper is accepted,
notably [P3247](https://wg21.link/P3247).
Which changes the requirements for constexpr support.
This will likely be preceded with [P3074](https://wg21.link/P3074).
These has not been implemented yet.

You can follow [this link](https://eel.is/c++draft/inplace.vector)
to checkout the status of `inplace_vector` in the latest draft.

Contributions are welcome.

### Code example

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <cassert>

#include <beman/inplace_vector/inplace_vector.hpp>

using namespace beman;

/**
 * Generates fibonacci sequence using inplace_vector.
 * See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence
 */
template <int Capacity>
constexpr inplace_vector<int, Capacity> fibonacci_to(int num) {
  assert(num < Capacity);

  inplace_vector<int, Capacity> vec;

  constexpr std::array<int, 2> first_two{0, 1};
  for (auto i = 0; i <= num; ++i) {
    auto new_val = i < 2 ? first_two[i] : vec[i - 1] + vec[i - 2];
    vec.push_back(new_val);
  }

  return vec;
}

/*
 * Check the result of the computation at compile time.
 */
constexpr bool check_5() {
  auto got = fibonacci_to<10>(5);
  constexpr inplace_vector<int, 10> correct{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5};
  return got == correct;
}

static_assert(check_5());

```

### Note on constexpr support

Since `constexpr` requirements are actively changing,
you can use `beman::has_constexpr_support` to detect if our implementation
provide constexpr support for a specific specialization of `inplace_vector`.

Note this is not part of the standard Library and should not be relied on once
`constexpr` requirement stabilize.

Example Usage:
`static_assert(beman::has_constexpr_support<beman::inplace_vector<int, 5>>)`.

## How to Build

### Compiler support

Building this repository requires **C++20** or later.

We will evaluate the possibility of partial support for C++17
when constexpr is fully supported and tested.

### Dependencies

Current implementation is tested against both GNU gcc and LLVM clang compilers.
More specifically, gcc version 12 to 14, and clang version 17 to 20.
Versions outside of this range will likely work as well,
they are just not tested in our current infrastructure.
We are working on expanding this range of compiler support,
and aim to bring `inplace_vector` to MSVC soon!

### Instructions

#### Using CMake Preset

[CMake Preset](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html)
is a new CMake functionality that provides one-line configure + test.

You can use `gcc-debug` to setup a debug orienated `inplace_vector` development environment.

```text
$ cmake --workflow --preset gcc-debug
Executing workflow step 1 of 3: configure preset "gcc-debug"

Preset CMake variables:

  BEMAN_BUILDSYS_SANITIZER="MaxSan"
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
  CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD="20"
  CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="cmake/gnu-toolchain.cmake"

Note that this workflow compiles the project with sanitizers,
if you wish to playaround with `inplace_vector` without sanitizers,
use `gcc-release`.

## Development

### Linting

This project use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework for linting.

#### Install pre-commit

```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
```

pre-commit can be configured to automatically triggered before git commit,
to install this functionality, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

#### Running pre-commit

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This will download and check linting rules on all files.
Apart from Markdown files,
`pre-commit` will automatically format the files
to conform with linting rules in place.
